# Deprecated

The **`<big>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) deprecated element renders the enclosed text at a font size one level larger than the surrounding text (`medium` becomes `large`, for example). The size is capped at the browser's maximum permitted font size.

> **Warning:** This element has been removed from the specification and shouldn't be used any more. Use the CSS font-size property to adjust the font size.
