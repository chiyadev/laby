The **`<blockquote>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see [Notes](#usage_notes) for how to change it). A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the **cite** attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the [`cite`](cite!) element.
