The **`<br>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.

As you can see from the above example, a `<br>` element is included at each point where we want the text to break. The text after the `<br>` begins again at the start of the next line of the text block.

> **Note:** Do not use `<br>` to create margins between paragraphs; wrap them in [`p`](p!) elements and use the [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) margin property to control their size.
