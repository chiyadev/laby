The **`<dt>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be used inside a [`dl`](dl!) element. It is usually followed by a [`dd`](dd!) element; however, multiple `<dt>` elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next [`dd`](dd!) element.

The subsequent [`dd`](dd!) (**Description Details**) element provides the definition or other related text associated with the term specified using `<dt>`.
