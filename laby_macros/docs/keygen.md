The **`<keygen>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element exists to facilitate generation of key material, and submission of the public key as part of an [HTML form](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms). This mechanism is designed for use with Web-based certificate management systems. It is expected that the `<keygen>` element will be used in an HTML form along with other information needed to construct a certificate request, and that the result of the process will be a signed certificate.
