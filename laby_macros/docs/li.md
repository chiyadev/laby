The **`<li>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to represent an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list ([`ol`](ol!)), an unordered list ([`ul`](ul!)), or a menu ([`menu`](menu!)). In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.
