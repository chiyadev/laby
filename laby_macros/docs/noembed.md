# Deprecated

The **`<noembed>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is an obsolete, non-standard way to provide alternative, or "fallback", content for browsers that do not support the [`embed`](embed!) element or do not support the type of [embedded content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#embedded_content) an author wishes to use. This element was deprecated in HTML 4.01 and above in favor of placing fallback content between the opening and closing tags of an [`object`](object!) element.

> **Note:** While this element currently still works in many browsers, it is obsolete and should not be used. Use [`object`](object!) instead, with fallback content between the opening and closing tags of the element.
