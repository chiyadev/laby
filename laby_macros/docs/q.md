The **`<q>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks. This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the [`blockquote`](blockquote!) element.
