The **`<s>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the `<s>` element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, `<s>` is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the [`del`](del!) and [`ins`](ins!) elements, as appropriate.
