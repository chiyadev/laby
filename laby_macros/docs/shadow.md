# Deprecated

The **`<shadow>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element—an obsolete part of the [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) technology suite—was intended to be used as a shadow DOM insertion point. You might have used it if you have created multiple shadow roots under a shadow host. It is not useful in ordinary HTML.
