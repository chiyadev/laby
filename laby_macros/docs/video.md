The **`<video>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can use `<video>` for audio content as well, but the [`audio`](audio!) element may provide a more appropriate user experience.

The above example shows simple usage of the `<video>` element. In a similar manner to the [`img`](img!) element, we include a path to the media we want to display inside the `src` attribute; we can include other attributes to specify information such as video width and height, whether we want it to autoplay and loop, whether we want to show the browser's default video controls, etc.

The content inside the opening and closing `<video></video>` tags is shown as a fallback in browsers that don't support the element.
