The **`<address>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.

The contact information provided by an `<address>` element's contents can take whatever form is appropriate for the context, and may include any type of contact information that is needed, such as a physical address, URL, email address, phone number, social media handle, geographic coordinates, and so forth. The `<address>` element should include the name of the person, people, or organization to which the contact information refers.

`<address>` can be used in a variety of contexts, such as providing a business's contact information in the page header, or indicating the author of an article by including an `<address>` element within the [`article`](article!).
