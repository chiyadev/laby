The **`<bdo>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element overrides the current directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction.

The text's characters are drawn from the starting point in the given direction; the individual characters' orientation is not affected (so characters don't get drawn backward, for example).
