# Deprecated

The **`<bgsound>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is deprecated. It sets up a sound file to play in the background while the page is used; use [`audio`](audio!) instead.

> **Warning:** Do not use this! In order to embed audio in a Web page, you should be using the [`audio`](audio!) element.
