# Deprecated

The **`<blink>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is a non-standard element which causes the enclosed text to flash slowly.

> **Warning:** Do not use this element as it is **obsolete** and is bad design practice. Blinking text is frowned upon by several accessibility standards and the CSS specification allows browsers to ignore the `<blink>` element.
