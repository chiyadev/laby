The **`<button>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs an action, such as submitting a [form](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms) or opening a dialog.

By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the user agent runs on, but you can change buttons' appearance with [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).
