The **`<col>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element defines a column within a table and is used for defining common semantics on all common cells. It is generally found within a [`colgroup`](colgroup!) element.

`<col>` allows styling columns using CSS, but only a few properties will have an effect on the column ([see the CSS 2.1 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#columns) for a list).
