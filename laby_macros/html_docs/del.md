The **`<del>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document. This can be used when rendering "track changes" or source code diff information, for example. The [`ins`](ins!) element can be used for the opposite purpose: to indicate text that has been added to the document.

This element is often (but need not be) rendered by applying a strike-through style to the text.
