# Deprecated

The **`<dir>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used as a container for a directory of files and/or folders, potentially with styles and icons applied by the user agent. Do not use this obsolete element; instead, you should use the [`ul`](ul!) element for lists, including lists of files.

> **Warning:** Do not use this element. Though present in early HTML specifications, it has been deprecated in HTML 4, and has since been removed entirely. **No major browsers support this element.**
