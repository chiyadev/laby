The **`<div>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout) is applied to its parent element).

As a "pure" container, the `<div>` element does not inherently represent anything. Instead, it's used to group content so it can be easily styled using the [`class`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes#class) or [`id`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes#id) attributes, marking a section of a document as being written in a different language (using the [`lang`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes#lang) attribute), and so on.
