The **`<embed>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element embeds external content at the specified point in the document. This content is provided by an external application or other source of interactive content such as a browser plug-in.

> **Note:** This topic documents only the element that is defined as part of the [HTML Living Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-embed-element). It does not address earlier, non-standardized implementation of the element.

Keep in mind that most modern browsers have deprecated and removed support for browser plug-ins, so relying upon `<embed>` is generally not wise if you want your site to be operable on the average user's browser.
