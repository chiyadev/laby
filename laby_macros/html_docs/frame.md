# Deprecated

The **`<frame>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element defines a particular area in which another HTML document can be displayed. A frame should be used within a [`frameset`](frameset!).

Using the `<frame>` element is not encouraged because of certain disadvantages such as performance problems and lack of accessibility for users with screen readers. Instead of the `<frame>` element, [`iframe`](iframe!) may be preferred.
