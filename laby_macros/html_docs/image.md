# Deprecated

The **`<image>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is an ancient and poorly supported precursor to the [`img`](img!) element.
**It should not be used**.

Some browsers will attempt to automatically convert this into an [`img`](img!) element, and may succeed if the `src", "img` attribute is specified as well.
