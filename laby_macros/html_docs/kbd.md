The **`<kbd>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a `<kbd>` element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.

`<kbd>` may be nested in various combinations with the [`samp`](samp!) (Sample Output) element to represent various forms of input or output based on visual cues.
