The **`<main>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents the dominant content of the [`body`](body!) of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.

A document mustn't have more than one `<main>` element that doesn't have the [`hidden`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes#hidden) attribute specified.
