The **`<menu>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is a semantic alternative to [`ul`](ul!). It represents an unordered list of items (represented by [`li`](li!) elements), each of these represent a link or other command that the user can activate.

> **Note:** In previous version of the HTML specification, the `<menu>` element had an additional use case as a context menu. This functionality is now considered obsolete, and has been removed from the specification. Firefox was the only browser to implement this functionality which included the `label` *(deprecated)* and `context` *(deprecated)* attributes.
