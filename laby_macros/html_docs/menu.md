The **`<menu>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is described in the HTML specification as a semantic alternative to [`ul`](ul!), but treated by browsers (and exposed through the accessibility tree) as no different than [`ul`](ul!). It represents an unordered list of items (which are represented by [`li`](li!) elements).
