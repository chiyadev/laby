The **`<menuitem>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a command that a user is able to invoke through a popup menu. This includes context menus, as well as menus that might be attached to a menu button.

A command can either be defined explicitly, with a textual label and optional icon to describe its appearance, or alternatively as an _indirect command_ whose behavior is defined by a separate element. Commands can also optionally include a checkbox or be grouped to share radio buttons. (Menu items for indirect commands gain checkboxes or radio buttons when defined against elements `<input type="checkbox">` and `<input type="radio">`.)
