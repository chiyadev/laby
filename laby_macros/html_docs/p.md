The **`<p>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

Paragraphs are [block-level elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements), and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing `</p>` tag. See "Tag omission" below.
