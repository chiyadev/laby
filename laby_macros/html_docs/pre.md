The **`<pre>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. The text is typically rendered using a non-proportional, or "[monospaced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font), font. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written.

If you have to display reserved characters such as `<`, `>`, `&`, `"` within the `<pre>` tag, the characters must be escaped using their respective [HTML entity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity).
