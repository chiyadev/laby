The **`<rp>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is used to provide fall-back parentheses for browsers that do not support display of ruby annotations using the [`ruby`](ruby!) element. One `<rp>` element should enclose each of the opening and closing parentheses that wrap the [`rt`](rt!) element that contains the annotation's text.
