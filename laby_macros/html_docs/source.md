The **`<source>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element specifies multiple media resources for the [`picture`](picture!), the [`audio`](audio!) element, or the [`video`](video!) element. It is an empty element, meaning that it has no content and does not have a closing tag. It is commonly used to offer the same media content in multiple file formats in order to provide compatibility with a broad range of browsers given their differing support for [image file formats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types) and [media file formats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats).
