# Deprecated

The **`<spacer>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is an obsolete HTML element which allowed insertion of empty spaces on pages. It was devised by Netscape to accomplish the same effect as a single-pixel layout image, which was something web designers used to use to add white spaces to web pages without actually using an image. However, `<spacer>` is no longer supported by any major browser and the same effects can now be achieved using simple CSS.

Firefox, which is the descendant of Netscape's browsers, removed support for `<spacer>` in version 4.
