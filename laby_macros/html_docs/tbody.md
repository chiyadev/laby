The **`<tbody>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element encapsulates a set of table rows ([`tr`](tr!) elements), indicating that they comprise the body of the table ([`table`](table!)).

The `<tbody>` element, along with its cousins [`thead`](thead!) and [`tfoot`](tfoot!), provide useful semantic information that can be used when rendering for either screen or printer as well as for accessibility purposes.
