The **`<time>`** [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a specific period in time. It may include the `datetime` attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders.

It may represent one of the following:

- A time on a 24-hour clock.
- A precise date in the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) (with optional time and timezone information).
- [A valid time duration](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#valid-duration-string).
